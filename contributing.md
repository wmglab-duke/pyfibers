- An understanding of the project's architecture and design principles.
- A GitHub account to fork the repository and create pull requests.

## Contributing

1. Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive and concise name for your branch that reflects the feature or issue you are addressing.
3. Implement your changes or fix the issue in your branch.
4. Ensure your code adheres to the code guidelines outlined below.
5. Write comprehensive tests to validate your changes and ensure the existing functionality remains intact.
6. Document your changes and update the project's documentation as necessary.
7. Commit your changes and provide a clear and meaningful commit message.
8. Push your branch to your forked repository.
9. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the main repository.
10. Collaborate with the project maintainers by addressing their feedback and making necessary changes to your pull request.
11. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch, and your contributions will become part of the project.

## Code Guidelines
